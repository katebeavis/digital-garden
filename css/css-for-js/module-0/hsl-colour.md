### HSL colour

- HSL stands for Hue. Saturation, Lightness
- Hue is pigment, measured in degrees
- Saturation is measured in percentage
- Lightness (similar to brightness) is measured in percentage

- HSL colours are more intuitive, i.e. to make a colour darker, decrease the lightness value

`hsl(200deg 100% 50%)`

- A fourth value can be passed - `alpha` This affects opacity. This is a unitless number between 0 ( fully transparent) and 1 (the default, fully opaque)

This version of HSL is not fully supported in IE, use comma separated values
